# mini_infra
This is the infrastructure for setting up my main "server" (currently a tiny mini PC),, which acts as a hypervisor to vms--as well as hosting containers and misc services itself.  I share it with my other devices using tailscale.

**Note:** Roles are being removed as I refactor them for [different hardware](https://github.com/ataylor-us/nuc_infra), this is just what remains for now.
